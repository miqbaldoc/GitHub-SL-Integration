{quote}The extend() method can be used to create objects dynamically from other objects passed in as arguments. In your case, it looks like the objects in the ‘$Array’ field do not have overlapping keys, so you can directly use the array as the arguments to extend. However, you cannot just pass ‘$Array’ to extend(), you need to use the spread operator to indicate that the elements of the array should be treated as the arguments to the function, like so:

{}.extend(...$Array)
The {} part just creates an empty object for us to call extend() on.

There are a few other examples of using the extend() method in the community, like this [one|https://community.snaplogic.com/t/json-array-value-to-column-formating/1950/2?u=tstack].{quote}

Unable to find any source documentation in the official MySQL Documentation that sheds more light on the concept of batching and connection pooling, a few forums discuss this but in a very generic fashion. I am aware that batching and connection pooling are commonly applied practises in most DBs and I am looking for a much more detailed information about this in terms of maximum and minimum limits, purpose, limitations, best practices, and so on . Have requested Terence for more information. Will have more updates based on his response. ","27/Nov/17 4:16 PM;aparekh;[~miqbal]: For the purpose of this ticket, all we need is the respective values, since our implementation maybe different.

*Batch size*
We use JDBC API [java.sql.executeBatch()|https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/Statement.html#executeBatch()] to execute SQL statements in batches, as per the API's description:
bq. Submits a batch of commands to the database for execution and if all commands execute successfully, returns an array of update counts. Batch execution is used to improve the performance.

batch size defines how many SQL statements can be executed in a single batch. For example, when inserting 100 records with batch size as 40, there will be 100 insert statements, and they are executed in 3 batches, the first and second batches contain 40 insert statements each and the third batch contains 20.

It is part of the JDBC standard, there is no maximum limit on the batch size. However, the JDBC drivers don't necessarily follow the standard and could throw exceptions if the batch size is too large for a specific driver, user should reduce the batch size if they see an exception saying the batch size is too large. 

What is a proper batch size depends on the specific db operations. Generally the larger the batch size is, the better the performance would be. But if the batch size is too large, sending a single batch request to the database server can take too long time and it would time out. User should test and monitor the performance with different batch sizes and decide the best batch size.

*Max pool size*
We use HikariCP(https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP) to do database connection pooling. The max pool size defines the maximum number of concurrent connections in a connection pool.

The number of max pool size depends how many concurrent connections that user needs. Each MySQL Snap holds a separate connection when running. For a pipeline that has 4 MySQL Insert, 2 MySQL Execute and 1 MySQL Update Snaps, the max pool size should be no less than 7 to make sure the pipeline can be executed successfully.","27/Nov/17 10:29 PM;miqbal;[~yzhang], thanks!

[DOC] update description on Batch size property for Salesforce SOQL/Read Snaps,SNAP-3220,32312,32000,Sub-task,Resolved,SNAP,Snap Dev,software,pavan,,,Medium,Done,miqbal,psung,psung,17/Oct/17 6:52 PM,22/Nov/17 8:46 PM,15/Jul/18 12:13 AM,22/Nov/17 8:46 PM,4.12,4.12,,Salesforce,,0,,,,"The Batch size property description should be replaced with the following phrases in the draft document for 4.12:

Required. This refers to the number of records in each batch during the download of large query results. Each batch read requires an API call against Salesforce to retrieve the set of records.

1. REST API:
The batch size to 200 and 2000 are valid in REST API.
According to the SFDC REST API documentation:
https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/headers_queryoptions.htm
""There is no guarantee that the requested batch size is the actual batch size. Changes are made as necessary to maximize performance.""
In fact, if the size of each record in the query result is relatively large (e.g. a few hundred output fields), SFDC may respond in a batch size of 200, And if the size of each record in the query result is relatively small, SFDC may respond in a batch size of 2000 regardless the Batch size is set to 200 or 2000.

2. Bulk API:
Selecting the values 100,000 or 250,000 will make the Bulk API request as PK-chinking with a chunk size of 100,000 or 250,000.
Other values 200 or 2000 will have the Snap submit a single regular Bulk API batch job to SFDC.
According to the SFDC Bulk API documentation:
https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/asynch_api_concepts_limits.htm
""15 attempts at 10 minutes each to process the batch. There is also a 2-minute limit on the time to process the query. If more than 15 attempts are made for the query, an error message of 'Tried more than fifteen times' is returned. If the query takes more than 2 minutes to process, a QUERY_TIMEOUT error is returned.""
Therefore, if the query is expected to take long time to execute (e.g. the target SObject has more than several hundred thousand records and the number of output fields in a record is more than a few hundreds), it is highly recommended to set this property to 100,000 or 250,000 to avoid timeout errors.

Add a new property description for 'Preview in Bulk API' after 'Match data type'.

If this property is true and the Salesforce API property is Bulk API, the Snap is executed in Bulk API during preview. If the query is expected to take long  to complete its execution, the preview will also take long or fail with a timeout error. Users may add ""LIMIT 50"" to the query to get the preview result fast.

If this property is false and Salesforce API property is Bulk API, the Snap previews in REST API. The data schema of the query results in REST API may be different from the ones in Bulk API, and the data types of some fields are different between REST API and Bulk API. This issue may result in cases where the pipeline previews successfully, but fails in execution.

*Default value*:  false

[Salesforce Read Snap]
This Snap executes in Bulk API if the Salesforce API property is Bulk API. (it used to execute in REST API before)
Delete ""In preview mode, the Snap always executes in REST API."" in the ""Salesforce API"" property description.
Also delete ""In preview mode, the Snap always executes in REST API, and this property value will have no effect."" in the Bulk content type property.

[Salesforce Lookup Snap]

  Documentation makes reference to changes in supported inbound TLS protocol as of Java 8.x, however, they also ask if there is a similar change to TLS supported protocol for outbound connections.

Documentation states:

""As of June 3, 2017, only TLS 1.2 is supported. TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are no longer seen as acceptable for security standards in the industry.  Any client (JCC, REST client, Java code, etc) that connects to SnapLogic triggered pipelines or the SnapLogic ...""

I don't see that anything was added for supported outbound connections.   

I believe we've told customers that outbound connections such as a pipeline calling SalesForce, it is entirely dependent on the outside endpoint.    However, outbound connections are not restricted to 1.2.

There is the following article by Oracle:

https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/entry/java_8_will_use_tls

If negotiation does fail, it could possibly be due to a combination unsupported cyphers or you may possibly need to force negotiation using different JVM switches that can be passed to the 'jcc.jvm_options' directive in the snaplex properties.
e.g., 
-Djdk.tls.client.protocols=""TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2""

Behavior will depend on the service endpoint and different services may behave differently.   Because these are global settings for the JCC, we do strongly recommend that any custom settings are isolated specifically to the Snaplexes that would be responsible for communicating to the internal TLS 1.0 endpoint noted.

","19/Jan/18 12:00 PM;jim;Was not able to get ahold of Iqbal after scrum.  Below is a description of changes.  Let me know if more detail is needed.  I am not sure if customer friendly means high level business abstraction or specific snap details in this case.

	•	Salesforce SOQL and Lookup snaps were made more consistent to SnapLogic snap guidelines of writing snap data exceptions to error views and continuing to next document versus hard stopping.
	•	Fixed existing snap errors that were not providing reason and resolution.
	•	Fixed snap data exceptions that were catching and replacing previous snap data exceptions. Now the original snap exception cause, reason, and resolution is provided.
	•	Added automated unit tests and improved existing unit tests to better catch future Salesforce snap changes that would otherwise change the behavior and consistency of existing Salesforce snaps.

I got in touch with the QA [~sreddi] for this ticket to capture the Before and After scenarios for this enhancement. I want to focus on SOQL and Lookup primarily since Adobe noticed the inconsistencies in these primarily and work my way through the other Snaps. 

While we can capture the After scenario without hassle, the 'Before' aspect will be tricky unless we have screenshots of the errors with us. This is not available from what I understand from Satish. [~rhowlett], please advise. ","16/Feb/18 9:14 AM;sreddi;[~miqbal]

Our snap documentation includes an example, pasted below, for SLDB protocol that works, however, if a customer changes the protocol to something like FTP or FTPS and the destination is Windows, the same expression would fail. 

We should warn users on the page that any protocol that supports a Windows destination will fail if reserved characters like colon (':') are in the filename, or will be inserted into the filename by an expression.

In our File Writer snap documentation we state the following:

From what I understand the following updates need to be made:
* When passing upstream parameters, client-side buffering must be used, or it should be ensured that null values are not passed from the upstream parameters. From the error message it seems that null values are passed from the upstream Snap, is that the case? Or does this error occur regardless of null values from upstream Snap?
* If the user wishes to not enable client-side buffering, then values can be passed only as pipeline parameters.

A few more thoughts on this:
* Does this apply to all parameters? Or does it apply only to Region, Queue, and Queue URL?
* Is this behavior repeated in SQS Consumer as well? That Snap also has similar configuration. [~atayi] may need to update the SQS Consumer doc as well.","30/Jan/18 12:38 AM;pmanzoor;[~miqbal] If client side buffering is disabled then batching is used and these properties are only evaluated once without documents i.e. the user can submit the values either direct values or through pipeline parameters. If client side buffering is enabled these properties are evaluated for each document.
This applies to the properties:  *region, queueName* and *queueUrl*
There will be no changes required for consumer snap.","31/Jan/18 12:04 AM;miqbal;The document has been updated to reflect this. Ready for review.

*+Updates made: 
+*
The *Limitations and Known Issues* section has been updated to document this. The following content was added:

""Snap-related Limitations:
Client-side buffering must be enabled when passing values for the Region, Queue name, and Queue URL properties as upstream parameters, else the Snap will throw an error. Alternatively, these values can be passed as pipeline parameters, this is particularly useful in case of FIFO queues where client-side buffering is not applicable.""

FYI [~rpramanik]","10/May/18 10:42 PM;sreddi;Had a discussion with [~miqbal] and the Salesforce Read snap for batch size tooltip is not updated. Hence moving this task to Reopened.
","11/May/18 10:17 AM;psung;[~miqbal]
 I do not know why Rob created this ticket as [Doc] ticket. It is good to be reviewed by the documentation team, though.
1. I agree that ""Batch size in number of records."" is better that ""Batch size in records."".
2. But, we should not remove the sentence about PK Chunking from the tooltip It is probably the most important part of the tooltip, because other than 100,000 and 250,000, SFDC tends to ignore the requested batch size.
3. It is also incorrect to say ""the SFDC Bulk API does not expose a configurable batch size and will automatically group batches with up to 10000 records in each batch."" I think this sentence was simplified from the original explanation in the Snap Reference. First of all, 10000 is no longer used. it remains in the selection for only backward-compatibility. We could say: ""... the SFDC Bulk API does not expose a configurable batch size and will automatically group batches with up to 2,000 records in each batch."" Initially, I wanted not to mention about 10,000 in the Snap Reference and remove it from the selection. But, it caused a regression after we released 4.12. So, it was put back into the selection.

Once we have a final version of tooltip, you can reassigned this to me so than I will make change for 4.14.","15/May/18 12:46 AM;miqbal;Thank you for your response [~psung]. From what you say I understand that:
* 10,000 is an option for backward compatibility and the default with SFDC is now 2000.
* For larger batch sizes (100,000/250,000) PK-Chunking will be used.

All the detail about SFDC not exposing a configurable batch size...can go in the documentation along with the content already in place over there. As a practise, tooltips should now be too detailed and should just show indicators regards the options available.

I am suggesting that we use the following text:
{color:#205081}Batch size in number of records. 
For REST API use 200 or 2000. For Bulk API use either 2,000/100,000/250,000 (PK Chunking will be used for 100,000/250,000){color}.
","15/May/18 8:33 AM;psung;[~miqbal]

When Snap pod is available for 4.14 QA, it will show up in Salesforce Read and SOQL Snaps.",15/May/18 12:20 PM;miqbal;Thank you [~psung]. Will mark this as 'Resolved' in that case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

_Hello,

When I was onsite at ecoATM last week, someone on their side wanted to be able to modify the HTTP response returned from a triggered task. For example, instead of returning a status 200, return a status 400. 

Both he and I went through the documentation at https://docs-snaplogic.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SD/pages/1438189/How+to+Run+a+Pipeline+from+a+URL+Triggered+Task and noticed the following:
1. The instructions provided do not work (we weren't able to get the status response to change). We tried various different options and approaches based on that help site, but it didn't work. 
2. At times, ""status"" is mentioned, at other times ""http_status_code"" is mentioned. So there's an inconsistency. 

We finally were able to get the status code to change, but via a different approach:
I just updated the ""Binary Header Properties"" in the JSON Formatter snap by having the status code listed there. Screenshot below:
  !JSON_Status code.png|thumbnail! 


Thus, please update the ""How to Run a Pipeline from a URL (Triggered Task)"" help page by removing the current steps for the status code and replacing with steps indicating to update the JSON Formatter snap. 


Thanks,

Ali

I was basing my understanding off a comment in decompress.java which states, ""The user has chosen AUTO and no compression was selected, so we assume the stream is plain text."" and observed behavior in the customer's pipeline where AUTO failed to read the file but selecting GZIP always worked. 

I took a deeper look at decompress.java this morning and I see now that we do take a peek at the header of the file for GZIP and BZIP headers. Since that is the case, it seems like the issue would be the file headers, though when I use the 'file' command on it it shows up as GZIP. Perhaps this should instead be an enhancement request to see if we can expand our peek into the headers? I also see that AUTO is described more in the main Description of the snap. 


",24/Apr/18 8:45 AM;tstack;Is there are bug for the case where GZIP worked and AUTO did not?,"24/Apr/18 8:47 AM;rsramkoski; Not yet. I can file one and attach the file.

The Compress snap will add a content-encoding header and the Decompress snap can use that to detect the format (note the content-encoding isn't showing up in the preview because of a platform bug).  But, it is highly unlikely that the binary document fed into the Decompress snap will have that field in the binary header.

*Office365 Shared Mailboxes*

This is a work in progress (SWAT-833). We hope that it will be enough to allow a user to specify a shared folder from a standard email account. However Microsoft also documents a different authentication mechanism that requires an additional property that we do not currently capture. I'll create an additional doc story if we must change the UI.

For now it will suffice to document that the EMAIL READER snap now offers suggestions including any shared mailboxes that the user is subscribed to. We do not list unsubscribed shared mailboxes since the assumption is that the user isn't interested in them - it should be easy for the user to change via their email client if desired. The EMAIL ARCHIVE and EMAIL DELETE snaps do not suggest shared folders.

The keystore and truststore are files on the groundplex. We probably have the distinction between keystores and truststores discussed elsewhere but in this case it comes down to how the hive server is configured.

1. If you don't need any authentication you shouldn't need either. That's unlikely to be the case.

2. If you only need to authenticate the server - as an additional step to verify that you're connected to the correct server - you'll need the truststore.

3. If you need to perform SSL user authentication to the server you'll need the keystore.

[~psung], there isn't a workaround here - SnapLogic are not the consumer here, it is Talend (I will update the ticket title). The Producer is only serializing String, when they probably want Avro in JSON.

See https://docs.confluent.io/current/schema-registry/docs/serializer-formatter.html

Towards the end of that release cycle, we decided to simply keep both the key and value as serialised string objects.  And that behaviour is existing since then.

If we want to support AVRO, it would be a major enhancement.","29/Jan/18 10:48 AM;rhowlett;[~gmekala] and [~pavan], see [~smudassir]'s comment above.","30/Jan/18 11:39 PM;vsrinivasan;Hi All, Could you please help me understand why this isn't being treated with more priority if we are modifying incoming json data and replacing that to invalid json (Strings with =).. It may be perception but HPE has escalated this as a serious data integrity issue if we are modifying data and me nor Vandana are able to defend / justify this. Thx.","31/Jan/18 12:24 AM;smudassir;[~vsrinivasan], your concern is valid.  However, FYI, Confluent Kafka supports storing data as key/value pair.  And both key and value can be of in any format (String, Number, Avro, etc).

In the initial release (Nov 2016), we kept the snaps simply by making both key and value as string (with key optional and value mandatory).  Based on your requirements, we are ready to enhance the snaps as and when needed.

However, such enhancements need to be done carefully ensuring backward-compatibility doesn't break.

We need to come up with elegant design where customers have the choice to specify the format for both key/value.  And based on their choice, we will store the data respectively.  This requires discussion with PM team.

HTH.","31/Jan/18 10:06 AM;rhowlett;Oh, I'm sorry [~vsrinivasan], I did not pay enough attention to the details of this ticket earlier and I had ticket-blindness when I looked at the ""Kafka Consumer Output.png"" file above. It was only reading your comment this morning that I finally groked what this customer was experiencing.

I believe this can be solved with a minor modification to the Confluent Kafka Producer Snap's settings. Skip to SOLUTION below if you wish to get to it directly.

Firstly, a summary of what is going wrong. The customer is feeding a document into the Producer Snap. Documents are of course JSON-based. However, the Producer only supports String serialization. What happens under the covers is that the code is basically calling {{.toString()}} on the object used as the message value. For simple values like Strings and numbers (e.g. ""ABC"" or 123) this will only convert them to a String format.

However, calling {{.toString()}} on a JSON document object can, depending on the underlying implementation, change the actual format of the message entirely. That is what is happening here. So the curly-brace and colon-based format of JSON is converted into a custom, human-readable String representation of that object.

SOLUTION:
To maintain that JSON format, instead of passing for example {{$}} as the Message value, the expression function {{JSON.stringify($)}} will convert the JSON document object to a String, but maintain the JSON format. I would then hope that the Talend consuming application will not have an issue reading and parsing the JSON content.

DEMONSTRATION:

The existing scenario described, resulting in non-JSON being sent:

 !20180131-1100_msg-val-$_invalid-json.png|thumbnail! 

And with the {{JSON.stringify($)}} change with a Mapper demonstrating that JSON content has been sent, consumed and can be parsed:

 !20180131-1105_json-stringify-$_valid-json.png|thumbnail! 

I would communicate the above to the customer ([~vdandu], [~pavan]). And yes, it is not great that we did not see this solution immediately. You can share our apologies.","31/Jan/18 10:13 AM;smudassir;Oh, is it json not avro? We should better document this. Recently, I had same complaint from support team. I asked them to do json.stringify() in producer. And use json.parse() after consumer. ","31/Jan/18 1:51 PM;vsrinivasan;[~rhowlett] Robin, Thank you so much - that explains and helps a lot. Me/Vandana will get back to them via the support ticket and imo it is a perfectly acceptable solution. As far as I know, they will know before hand the format being sent to Kafka to decide when to use stringify and when not to. If that is not the case, we can discuss then on if we need pipeline pre processing or would need the snap to automatically handle multiple formats.

The Snap reference draft has been updaed:
https://mysnaplogic.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SPD/pages/60571961/Worksheet+Writer

Single batch write:
""If selected, the Snap stores the worksheet data in its internal buffer as it processes the input document stream and writes the entire worksheet data in one batch when it receives the end of input document stream. Google Sheets service limits the total number of cells in a spreadsheet to 2 million cells. A spreadsheet may contain multiple worksheets. The cell count limit applies to the sum of all worksheets in a spreadsheet. If the Snap fetches an input document and it will exceed the cell count limit, the current and all subsequent input documents are written to the error view as part of error documents.

If not selected, the Snap writes the worksheet data one row or one cell at a time. Therefore, when the property is selected, the Snap writes a worksheet much faster than the property not selected. Since the single batch write mode stores the entire worksheet data in its internal buffer, users should make sure the system have sufficient memory.

It is incorrect to say:

It should be changed to:
""Google Sheets limits the maximum number of cells in one Google spreadsheet to 2 million. The Snap monitors the total cell count in a spreadsheet ...""

""This Snap polls a directory looking for files matching the specified pattern. It repeats the polling in every interval given in the Polling interval property until the timeout value given in the Polling timeout property. Directory Browser Snap should be used if more than a few files are to be listed only once. Any subfolder in the directory is ignored.

A typical use case of File Poller Snap is as following:

Initially there is no matching file in a directory and File Poller continue to poll the directory in a given internal. When the Snap finds one or more matching files, it writes one output document for each file. The downstream Snaps processes each document and delete the file at the end of the processing before the time value of the Polling interval property lapses. If the matched files are not deleted within the polling interval, the same path will be written to the output view of the File Poller Snap. It completes the execution when it reaches the time value of the Polling timeout property.""",,miqbal,psung,rchaudhary,rhowlett,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pending,,,Pending,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Customer Escalation,,Normal,,ClubCorp USA,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|i00n27:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sev 5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,dmikhaylutsa,2018-06-11 22:07:59.299,,,"11/Jun/18 3:07 PM;rhowlett;[~miqbal], I'm putting this in-progress as you are assigned.","26/Jun/18 11:19 PM;miqbal;Will also include the AWS JDK limitation to make it clear to the user that if there are over 10,000 files in a S3 folder, the Directory Browser or File Poller Snap may not give accurate results.

Paul's original comment in the parent ticket regards this:
""BTW, there is a defect in the version of AWS Java SDK we are currently using if there are very large number of files in an S3 bucket ( > 10,000). It stops to sending all files. But it applies the same to Directory Browser and File Poller. This issue may not be bumping into that defect, though. If we update the AWS SDK, it will affect a large number of Snaps and a huge amount of regression testing is required.

[Docs] Set custom character set to SQL Server Bulk Load Snap,SWAT-1452,37052,,Bug,Open,SWAT,SWAT,software,gmekala,,,Low,,miqbal,sghawde,sghawde,25/May/18 1:37 PM,29/Jun/18 2:50 AM,15/Jul/18 12:13 AM,,,,,,,0,LiveDocs_TBU,Orphan,,"SQL server bulk load snap invokes bcp utlity internally to load the bulk data into SQL server tables. 

Snaplogic snaps are defined to work at UTF-8 default character set. But when bcp (SS bulk load) snap writes data to target tables, some of the special and multi byte characters are written as junk characters. This behavior is because our Snaplex uses character sets defined on OS which they are installed (Windows in this case)

In order to set the desired character set, following batch file needs to be edited.

Make a bcp.bat batch file with these contents:

bcp.exe %* -C 1252

and then set the bcp.bat file as the absolute path to bcp and it will correctly set the codepage for BCP. 

Please have this feature tested and add to documentation.

Please Note - This is only applicable for *Windows based Snaplexes.*

""If selected, the Snap checks if all input documents are flat map data. Flat map data is a collection of key/value pairs, where the values are all single class objects other than Map or List. If any value is a Map or a List object, the Snap writes an error to the error view. If this condition happens, no document is written to the output view. If input documents are not flat map data, users may use Mapper Snap to transform the value to a data type which corresponds to the column data type in the target Redshift table. If this property is not selected, the Snap does not check input documents, converts all values to strings, writes S3 CSV file, and executes Redshift COPY command. If COPY command finds error in the input CSV data, errors are written to the error table and the Snap routes these errors to the error view. However, some errors reported by COPY command may not be easy to understand. Therefore, it is recommended to select this property during the pipeline building and testing, which may help troubleshoot the pipeline.""",,miqbal,psung,rchaudhary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pending,,,Pending,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Customer Escalation,,Normal,,Worcester Polytechnic Institute,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other (explain in Comments),,,,,,,,1|i00oo7:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sev 5,,M,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,pkoppishetty,2018-06-22 13:00:54.543,,,"22/Jun/18 6:00 AM;miqbal;Reviewed and edited Paul's original content.
